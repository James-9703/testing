# User Activity Monitoring System (UAM)
This project is a User Activity Monitoring (UAM) system built using Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, ksqlDB, and Docker. It tracks user activities, monitors sudo commands, detects security violations, and logs events for auditing purposes. The system leverages Kafka for real-time data streaming, ksqlDB for stream processing, PostgreSQL for persistent storage, and Prometheus for monitoring.
Features

Real-time User Activity Tracking: A producer sends user activity data to a Kafka broker at fixed intervals.
Sudo Command Monitoring: A dedicated producer watches for sudo commands and forwards them to the Kafka broker.
Security Violation Detection: A Kafka Streams application identifies potential security violations from user activity.
Audit Trail: Sudo commands are logged into a PostgreSQL database for auditing.
Monitoring: Prometheus tracks the Kafka broker's online status.
Containerized Deployment: All components (Kafka broker, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, ksqlDB, and ksql CLI) are managed via Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the system, ensure you have the following installed:

Git
Docker and Docker Compose
Java (for running the producer and sudo watcher applications)
Linux with xorg and account with sudo access

## Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository
```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd UAM/
```
Install Dependencies
    Run the setup script to install necessary tools and configure the environment:
```bash

    sudo ./setup.sh
```
 Start Core Services
    Launch Kafka broker, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, ksqlDB, and ksql CLI using Docker Compose:
```bash

    docker compose -f kafka.yml up
```
Usage
1. Monitor with Prometheus.
    Prometheus is used to monitor the Kafka broker's status. After starting the core services:

    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:9090/.
    Run the query ```up ```to verify that the Kafka broker instance is online.

2. Start the User Activity Producer in a new shell
This application generates and sends user activity data to the Kafka broker:
```bash
cd producer/app/build/libs/
java -jar app.jar
```
3. Start the Sudo Command Watcher in a new shell
This application monitors sudo commands and sends them to the Kafka broker:
```bash
cd ~/UAM/sudoWatch/app/build/libs/
java -jar app.jar
```
4. Test with a Sample Sudo Command in a new shell
Run a sudo command to produce sample data:
```bash
sudo ls
```
5. Start Stream Processing in a new shell
Launch the Kafka Streams applications to process data for security violations and audit logging:
```bash

cd ~/UAM/
docker compose -f process.yml up
```
6. Verify Sudo Command Logging in a new shell
Check if the sudo command is logged in the PostgreSQL database:
```bash

docker exec -it db psql -U postgres
```
In the PostgreSQL shell, run:
```sql

select * from sudo;
```
7. Monitor Security Violations
Start the ksql CLI as a dashboard to query the Kafka stream:
```bash

docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server:8088
```
Create a stream to read user activity from the Kafka topic statusV:
```ksqldb-cli

CREATE STREAM violation (
    username STRING, 
    ip STRING, 
    openedApp ARRAY<VARCHAR>, 
    idleTime INT, 
    firewall BOOLEAN, 
    pw INT, 
    violation STRING
) WITH (
    kafka_topic='statusV', 
    value_format='json'
);
```
Query the stream to display violations in real-time:
```ksqldb-cli

SELECT username, ip, violation FROM violation EMIT CHANGES;
```
Project Structure
